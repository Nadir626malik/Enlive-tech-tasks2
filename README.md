JavaScript Projects

Topics Covered

DOM Event Delegation – Handle events on dynamically added elements using parent listeners.

Virtual DOM Comparison – Compare two DOM trees and update only changed nodes.

Dynamic UI from JSON – Create, update, and remove elements based on JSON data.

var vs let vs const – Different scoping rules in nested blocks/functions.

Variable Leak – Fix global leaks with closures/IIFE.

Temporal Dead Zone – let & const throw errors before initialization, unlike var.

Type Checking Utility – Detect primitives & reference types accurately (null, NaN).

Deep Compare Function – Check equality of objects, arrays, and primitives.

Primitive Wrappers – Converting primitives to objects and back.

Function vs Variable Hoisting – Functions hoist fully, variables partially.

Hoisting in Loop – var causes unexpected results, fix with let.

Modules vs Script Hoisting – Modules use block scope + strict mode by default.

Counter with Closures – Independent counters without interfering.

Greeting Factory – Returns different functions by time of day.

Closures in React Hooks – Example: useState maintains values between renders.

Recreate map/filter/reduce – Implement core array methods manually.

Flatten Nested Array – Reduce + recursion to flatten arrays.

Validation with some/every – Quick data checks in arrays.

Polyfill for Object.assign – Copy properties from one object to another.

Object.entries/fromEntries – Convert objects ↔ arrays while transforming.

Object.seal vs Object.freeze – Seal restricts deletion/addition, Freeze makes full immutability.

Deep Copy Function – Clone nested objects safely, handle circular refs.

Shallow Copy Bug – Nested objects still reference same memory.

Cloning Performance – Shallow = faster, Deep = safer.
